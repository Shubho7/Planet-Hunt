<h2>Planet Hunt: A Revolutionary Exoplanet Habitability Predictor</h2>
Planet Hunt is developed using deep learning concepts where the core model leverages a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) architecture to classify exoplanetary data and assess the potential habitability of planets outside our solar system. With an impressive accuracy of 99.01%, this tool offers a robust solution for researchers and enthusiasts interested in the search for habitable planets.

<h5>Model Overview</h5>
The Planet Hunt model is built atop a multilayer perceptron (MLP), enhanced with four additional layers to optimize performance. Through extensive hyperparameter tuning and fine-tuning, this architecture is designed to perform highly accurate predictions. The key challenge in the development of this model was to handle the imbalanced distribution of habitable versus uninhabitable planets, which we tackled with several advanced techniques.
